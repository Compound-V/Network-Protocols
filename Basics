Basics of Networking

A network is a collection of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources using a set of defined protocols over a common transmission medium.

Networking is the process of connecting various devices so that they can communicate with each other and share information and resources

Network protocols are sets of rules or standards used by devices to communicate with each other over a network.

Network protocols can be broadly categorized into "layers". Each layer relies on the layer below it and provides services to the layer above it.
